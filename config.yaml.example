# If hoursToRespond is specified, then a line will be drawn on
# time series graphs at the position specified; the idea here is
# that if you'd like to respond to PRs or issues within a certain
# period, you can then look at the Time To Respond graph for issues
# and see whether you're meeting that. Defining this option will also
# make the list-of-issues (and PRs) widget show how many issues were 
# not responded to in this time.

# Provide an authentication key to require authentication to edit
# organizations and notes. Supported authentication types are:
#     github:
#         This requires a client_id and client_secret, which are obtainable
#         by registering a Github OAuth2 app as per instructions at
#         https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/basics-of-authentication/
#         and an organization. This is not a Measure organization, it's a
#         Github organization; anyone who signs in with Github and is a
#         member of that Github organization will have admin rights in the
#         dashboards and can create and edit Measure organization memberships.
#         When registering, add the authorization callback URL as
#         http://your-measure-deployment/github-login.php
